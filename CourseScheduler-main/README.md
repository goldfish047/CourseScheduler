# Group 14 - Proposal

## ‚ú®ABSTRACTüñå

The FIC Course Scheduler is a web application designed to simplify the process of scheduling courses for students and staff at FIC. The days of manual scheduling are over as our project aims to provide a convenient and user-friendly solution. It encompasses multiple features that work together to enhance the scheduling experience. The application will allow users to create mock schedules, check for course overlaps, ability to favorite preferred schedules, check credit eligibility and explore different placement options. 

The FIC Course Scheduler also offers a waitlisting feature, allowing students to join a waitlist for full courses. They are notified promptly if a spot becomes available, to secure their position. The scheduler ensures that courses with specific classroom requirements, like computing labs, are assigned suitable spaces. It also considers the availability of professors for course sections, ensuring instructors are available during the specified time slots. 

With the integration of Google Calendar API, users will have the option to seamlessly synchronize their course schedules with their Google Calendar accounts. This will enable students and professors to have a unified view of their academic and personal schedules, allowing for better time management and coordination. 

The target audience for the FIC Course Scheduler includes students and faculty members of FIC. The project aims to make their lives easier by providing a convenient and efficient solution for scheduling courses. By streamlining the scheduling process, the application offers improved organization, reduced conflicts, and enhanced flexibility for students and faculty.
With a variety of features and a clear scope, the FIC Course Scheduler project provides ample work for a group of five members. Each member can take ownership of specific features, collaborating to build a comprehensive and robust solution. The team can alternate responsibilities if needed, ensuring efficient progress and minimizing confusion.




## üìöSTORIESüìñ

One of the main stories we considered when planning out the FIC Course Scheduler was about a student who wanted to make a mock schedule to plan out what their next semester would look like. This story facilitated the idea of making a time table display on the course selector page which provides a visual representation of what the student‚Äôs schedule would look like. Another story we considered was of a student who is on academic probation attempting to enroll in some upper division classes. This led us to the decision of implementing the credit eligibility feature which checks whether or not a student is eligible to take a class based on their academic standing. For example, students on academic probation can only enroll into first year classes (100 level classes) while a student who isn‚Äôt on academic probation can enroll into whatever classes they want given that they have the prerequisites. 



## üèÜCOMPETITIVE ANALYSISüìä

There are many features present in other schedulers such as goSFU that can be added on to make the course scheduling process easier and efficient for students and staff. Features that should be considered to be added if time allows include filtering class schedules to student time preferences, allowing the student to filter classes based on if they are full or not and letting the student select which specific lab block they want. Overall these extra features make course scheduling even more seamless and efficient.



## üë•GROUP MEETINGSüó£üî•üî•üî•
Our group plans to meet twice a week in person after class, and we‚Äôre using Discord for communication. On our first meeting on June 6, 2023, we took the opportunity to get to know each other and discussed the requirements for this project.

In the second meeting on June 8, 2023, we explored different course scheduling websites and brainstormed some features we would like to incorporate. Such as bookmarking a favorite schedule, waitlist function, and the ability to check for class overlaps. We plan to make the project somewhat flexible, so it allows us to add more features and functions as we continue to develop the application.

During the third meeting on June 14, 2023, we worked on the UI mock up and discussed the layout of the web page. We also agreed that each of us would take turns leading the meetings, ensuring that everyone feels included and involved.

In the fourth meeting held on June 16, 2023, we discussed possible APIs we could use for the project. After careful consideration, we finalized the layout of the webpage, ensuring that it meets the project requirements and aligns with our vision.
