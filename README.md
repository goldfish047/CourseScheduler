## ‚ú®ABSTRACTüñå

The FIC Course Scheduler is a web application designed to simplify the process of scheduling courses for students and staff at FIC. The days of manual scheduling are over as our project aims to provide a convenient and user-friendly solution. The application considers the availability of professors, professor preferences and specific classroom requirements when generating schedules. Administrators can easily check instructor availability within the application, allowing for seamless identification of suitable time slots for classes based on professors' schedules.

FIC Scheduler provides a comprehensive course schedule and registration status for each day of the week, ensuring administrators have a clear overview of registered courses. Administrators can efficiently manage and organize academic schedules by utilizing flexible filters based on professor numbers, offered courses, and sections. The schedule is displayed in a table format, with room numbers as columns and times as rows, aligning course, instructor, and section information for easy reference.

Additionally, a map API integration offers a visual reference of the Fraser International College campus on the welcome page, enhancing the user experience. To further enhance user experience, the FIC Scheduler includes both light and dark modes, accommodating diverse user preferences and creating a visually appealing interface. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, the FIC Scheduler revolutionizes class scheduling, providing administrators with an effective tool for optimized academic planning at Fraser International College.

The target audience for the FIC Course Scheduler includes students and faculty members of FIC. The project aims to make their lives easier by providing a convenient and efficient solution for scheduling courses. By streamlining the scheduling process, the application offers improved organization, reduced conflicts, and enhanced flexibility for students and faculty.
With a variety of features and a clear scope, the FIC Course Scheduler project provides ample work for a group of five members. Each member can take ownership of specific features, collaborating to build a comprehensive and robust solution. The team can alternate responsibilities if needed, ensuring efficient progress and minimizing confusion.

## CUSTOMER
The primary customers would be the administrative team or staff members responsible for creating class schedules within Fraser International College. This team would typically consist of administrators, schedulers, or academic coordinators who have the authority and responsibility to manage and organize the class schedules for the institution.

## üèÜCOMPETITIVE ANALYSISüìä

The FIC scheduler application, designed exclusively for administrators, offers several advantages over the goSFU scheduling system used by students. While the goSFU system primarily caters to students' scheduling needs, the FIC scheduler focuses on the specific requirements administrators are responsible for when creating and managing class schedules. Unlike the goSFU system, which is student-oriented, the FIC scheduler provides a secure login system that ensures only authorized administrators can access the application. Moreover, the FIC scheduler takes into account professors' availability and specific classroom requirements when generating schedules, which might be similar to the backend process in goSFU. Similar to goSFU, the schedules are presented in a convenient calendar format, allowing administrators to visualize and manage class schedules efficiently. However, the FIC scheduler displays all classes scheduled for a given day, providing a comprehensive overview, whereas the goSFU system only shows classes selected by students. Administrators also benefit from the ability to filter classes by professor names and departments, enabling efficient management and organization of academic schedules. Overall, the FIC scheduler application caters specifically to the needs of administrators, providing them with a tool for streamlining class scheduling processes within the FIC institution.


## üë•GROUP MEETINGSüó£üî•üî•üî•
Our group plans to meet twice a week in person after class, and we‚Äôre using Discord for communication. On our first meeting on June 6, 2023, we took the opportunity to get to know each other and discussed the requirements for this project.

In the second meeting on June 8, 2023, we explored different course scheduling websites and brainstormed some features we would like to incorporate. Such as bookmarking a favorite schedule, waitlist function, and the ability to check for class overlaps. We plan to make the project somewhat flexible, so it allows us to add more features and functions as we continue to develop the application.

During the third meeting on June 14, 2023, we worked on the UI mock up and discussed the layout of the web page. We also agreed that each of us would take turns leading the meetings, ensuring that everyone feels included and involved.

In the fourth meeting held on June 16, 2023, we discussed possible APIs we could use for the project. After careful consideration, we finalized the layout of the webpage, ensuring that it meets the project requirements and aligns with our vision.

In the fifth meeting held on June 21, 2023, we reviwed different template choices for the login page and decided on the one which best resonated with FIC. Additionally, we worked on possible password requirements for the login. 

During the sixth meeting held on June 23, 2023, we explored specific requirements to create a new authenticated account. We decided on the username and password requirements to create a secure login.
