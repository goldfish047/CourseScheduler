# Group 14 - Proposal

## ‚ú®ABSTRACTüñå

The FIC Course Scheduler is a web application designed to simplify the process of scheduling courses for students and staff at FIC. The days of manual scheduling are over as our project aims to provide a convenient and user-friendly solution. The application considers the availability of professors, professor preferences and specific classroom requirements when generating schedules. Administrators can easily check instructor availability within the application, allowing for seamless identification of suitable time slots for classes based on professors' schedules.

FIC Scheduler provides a comprehensive course schedule and registration status for each day of the week, ensuring administrators have a clear overview of registered courses. Administrators can efficiently manage and organize academic schedules by utilizing flexible filters based on professor numbers, offered courses, and sections. The schedule is displayed in a table format, with room numbers as columns and times as rows, aligning course, instructor, and section information for easy reference.

Additionally, a map API integration offers a visual reference of the Fraser International College campus on the welcome page, enhancing the user experience. To further enhance user experience, the FIC Scheduler includes both light and dark modes, accommodating diverse user preferences and creating a visually appealing interface. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, the FIC Scheduler revolutionizes class scheduling, providing administrators with an effective tool for optimized academic planning at Fraser International College.

The target audience for the FIC Course Scheduler includes students and faculty members of FIC. The project aims to make their lives easier by providing a convenient and efficient solution for scheduling courses. By streamlining the scheduling process, the application offers improved organization, reduced conflicts, and enhanced flexibility for students and faculty.
With a variety of features and a clear scope, the FIC Course Scheduler project provides ample work for a group of five members. Each member can take ownership of specific features, collaborating to build a comprehensive and robust solution. The team can alternate responsibilities if needed, ensuring efficient progress and minimizing confusion.



## üìöSTORIESüìñ

One of the main stories we considered when planning out the FIC Course Scheduler was about a student who wanted to make a mock schedule to plan out what their next semester would look like. This story facilitated the idea of making a time table display on the course selector page which provides a visual representation of what the student‚Äôs schedule would look like. Another story we considered was of a student who is on academic probation attempting to enroll in some upper division classes. This led us to the decision of implementing the credit eligibility feature which checks whether or not a student is eligible to take a class based on their academic standing. For example, students on academic probation can only enroll into first year classes (100 level classes) while a student who isn‚Äôt on academic probation can enroll into whatever classes they want given that they have the prerequisites. 



## üèÜCOMPETITIVE ANALYSISüìä

There are many features present in other schedulers such as goSFU that can be added on to make the course scheduling process easier and efficient for students and staff. Features that should be considered to be added if time allows include filtering class schedules to student time preferences, allowing the student to filter classes based on if they are full or not and letting the student select which specific lab block they want. Overall these extra features make course scheduling even more seamless and efficient.



## üë•GROUP MEETINGSüó£üî•üî•üî•
Our group plans to meet twice a week in person after class, and we‚Äôre using Discord for communication. On our first meeting on June 6, 2023, we took the opportunity to get to know each other and discussed the requirements for this project.

In the second meeting on June 8, 2023, we explored different course scheduling websites and brainstormed some features we would like to incorporate. Such as bookmarking a favorite schedule, waitlist function, and the ability to check for class overlaps. We plan to make the project somewhat flexible, so it allows us to add more features and functions as we continue to develop the application.

During the third meeting on June 14, 2023, we worked on the UI mock up and discussed the layout of the web page. We also agreed that each of us would take turns leading the meetings, ensuring that everyone feels included and involved.

In the fourth meeting held on June 16, 2023, we discussed possible APIs we could use for the project. After careful consideration, we finalized the layout of the webpage, ensuring that it meets the project requirements and aligns with our vision.
